    summary:
      "A native to upstate NY; Jason was born and raised in Syracuse, NY. Upon graduating from Jamesville-DeWitt High School in 2012, Jason moved to Rochester, NY to begin his freshman year at Nazareth College in Pittsford, NY, a suburb of Rochester, NY. There he was enrolled in a double major of Business Management and Spanish.\n\nDuring that freshman year, Jason matured greatly and learned a great deal about himself; and in learning more about his goals and values, Jason decided that a larger university, with greater resources and a curriculum that was more focused on technical skills would be a better match for his skills, aptitudes and desired career paths. After a great deal of research and consideration, Jason transferred to Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in 2013 enrolled in the Saunders College of Business and enrolled in the New Media Marketing major offered there.\n\nWith a new school and a new major, Jason excelled, reaching Dean’s list more often than not, and taking on membership and leadership roles in various organizations on campus.\n\nAfter a year in the New Media Marketing program, Jason had the opportunity to take an introductory Web Development introduction class that would help fulfill his minor in Digital Business. Here student’s learned how to create basic web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but what was just a checklist item became Jason’s favorite class. It was then Jason realized his interest and passion for code; he loved the creativity and customization it allowed. He craved more.\n\nPromptly he scheduled a meeting with the his academic advisor to see how best to incorporate more development into his curriculum. It was then that Jason adopted a new major: Management Information Systems or “MIS”, where he would have the opportunity to learn technologies and skills including database management systems, application development, and architectural planning.\n\nAs Jason progressed through the MIS program, he felt himself continually craving more and programming knowledge. He didn’t want to just write the convert business needs to technical requirements, write database schemas, create architectural documentation, user-stories and other technical documentation - Jason wanted to write the application himself. All of it. \n\nWorking with the academic faculty and staff of both the Golisano College of Computer and Information Sciences (GCCIS) and the Saunder’s College of Business, Jason adopted Web Development as a minor - a minor intended only for Computer Science students; it was very uncommon for non-computer science students to elect such a minor primarily due to all the prerequisite course requirements - which in summation totaled 29 college credits, nearly double that of most minors (5 classes). On top of a second minor (Digital Business) and a concentration (3 classes) in Psychology.\n\nJason felt his most employable attribute was that he could speak the lingo of the business, and of the developer. It is all too common in that company’s have a disconnect between the business leaders/decision-maker’s and the software developers; as if the two parties simply didn’t speak the same language. This is where he felt that he could be of greatest utility to company; using his interpersonal skills to convert business requirements to technical requirements and even deliver on the build of the product.\n\nIn 2017, Jason graduated. He’d done well; achieved Dean’s list more often than he did not, he’d had multiple paid co-ops, and taken leadership roles in many on-campus organizations, while working multiple jobs, actively participating in clubs and greek life, and averaging more than a full-course (15 credits) load most semesters. \n\nNo sooner than the Monday following completion of his degree in Management Information Systems, Jason started work at Rochester Precision Optics (RPO) as a “Data Analyst/Programmer” where he helped analyze information in RPO’s ERP system Epicor to provide insight into production efficiencies/deficiencies, supplier pricing, deliver, and a multitude of other KPIs to help RPO use its resources (both human capital, physical capital, and operating time) as effectively as possible, including automating reporting of KPIs for the Director of Supply chain and even validating payroll information using automated pulls from their ERP system passed through an algorithm he spent weeks developing in collaboration with the company’s accounting and payroll departments.\n\nWhile Jason loved working at RPO - especially the 9/80 schedule; Jason missed one thing above all else - a team. A person can grow more, learn more, achieve more - when they work with others on a common goal, so when Jason received a call from Paychex, interested in interviewing him for a position in their IT department, his interest was peaked. \n\nAfter interviewing and screening, Jason got accepted Paychex’s job offer for Desktop Engineer I at Paychex, where he would focus on automating the processes of managing Paychex’s end-user computing environment to ensure a stable, highly-available, and highly performant computing environment, this time as part of a team of engineers from whom he could learn and grow. \n\nJason spent about a year and a half at Paychex, during which time he was promoted to Desktop Engineer II, and was able to make numerous impactful contributions to the organization, and get involved and even lead multiple projects that had visibility to the executive staff at Paychex, but as time progressed, Jason kept feeling a greater and greater itch to for a different kind of challenge; a challenge where he could use and grow his programming knowledge and solve real-world business problems with software - an idea that still incites excitement.\n\nAfter great consideration and consultation with mentors, peers, family and friends - Jason decided to take a risk and quit his job as an engineer to attend a Software Engineering bootcamp. With reluctance, Jason gave his notice and began preparing for a move across the country to Denver, CO where he would re-new his excitement and passion for programming and gain, where he could truly hone his development skills, meet like-minded peers, network with the software development community and get real experience building full-stack applications.\n\nNow closing on graduation from the Flatiron School - completing his bootcamp in Software Engineering, Jason is looking for opportunities to use his creativity and problem-solving skills to contribute to the growth and advancement of software to make meaningful impacts. It is now that the real journey begins. ",

David's victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn't have won.\n\nOr should he have?\n\nIn David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell challenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks. \n\nGladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern Ireland's Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms - all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity.\n\nIn the tradition of Gladwell's previous best sellers, David and Goliath draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think about the world around us.",

        'n this must-listen book for anyone striving to succeed, pioneering psychologist Angela Duckworth shows parents, educators, students, and businesspeople - both seasoned and new - that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a focused persistence called "grit".\n\nWhy do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, MacArthur "genius" Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial, such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.\n\nDrawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own "character lab" and set out to test her theory.\n\nHere, she takes listeners into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she\'s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers - from J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll.\n\nWinningly personal, insightful, and even life changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down and how that - not talent or luck - makes all the difference.',

What could you accomplish if you could stay focused and overcome distractions? What if you had the power to become \"indistractable\"?\n\nInternational best-selling author, former Stanford lecturer, and behavioral design expert, Nir Eyal, wrote Silicon Valley's handbook for making technology habit-forming. Five years after publishing Hooked, Eyal reveals distraction's Achilles' heel in his groundbreaking new book.\n\nIn Indistractable, Eyal reveals the hidden psychology driving us to distraction. He describes why solving the problem is not as simple as swearing off our devices: Abstinence is impractical and often makes us want more. \n\nEyal lays bare the secret of finally doing what you say you will do with a four-step, research-backed model. Indistractable reveals the key to getting the best out of technology, without letting it get the best of us. \n\nInside, Eyal overturns conventional wisdom and reveals: \n\nWhy distraction at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture - and how to fix it\nWhat really drives human behavior and why \"time management is pain management\"\nWhy your relationships (and your sex life)depend on you becoming indistractable\nHow to raise indistractable children in an increasingly distracting world\n\nEmpowering and optimistic, Indistractable provides practical, novel techniques to control your time and attention - helping you live the life you really want.",

Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.\n\nClear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.Learn how to:\n\nmake time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);\novercome a lack of motivation and willpower; \ndesign your environment to make success easier;\nget back on track when you fall off course;\nand much more. \n\nAtomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits - whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.",

        'In January 2019, culture writer Anne Helen Petersen set the Internet on fire with her viral BuzzFeed essay diagnosing "millennial burnout"—a chronic state of stress and exhaustion that’s become a "base temperature" for young people today. Now, she continues this generation-defining conversation in a brand-new format, interviewing millennials around the country about their own deeply personal experiences with burnout and the culture that creates it. Listeners will hear about how this issue has affected Petersen’s own life as well as the lives of five very different subjects: Kevin, a musician and Marine veteran; Kate, a first-generation college graduate working to repay her formidable student debt; Haley and Evette, young writers at different career stages in the digital media industry; and John, a pastor and co-founder of a new Baptist church in North Carolina.\n\nThe conversations that comprise The Burnout Generation cover everything from debt to social media to the blurred boundaries between our professional and personal lives. In this illuminating and intimate audio project, listeners learn how and why this generation has been conditioned to "optimize" every aspect of our lives (Meal prep for the week! Find a side hustle! But practice self-care! And answer emails in bed!), and most importantly, how the consequences of this phenomenon play out in day-to-day life.',

      summary:
        "Everyone knows that regular exercise and weight training lead to physical strength. But how do we strengthen ourselves mentally for the truly tough times? And what should we do when we face these challenges? Or as psychotherapist Amy Morin asks, what should we avoid when we encounter adversity? Through her years counseling others and her own experiences navigating personal loss, Morin realized it is often the habits we cannot break that are holding us back from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity or agonizing over things beyond our control, obsessing over past events, resenting the achievements of others, or expecting immediate positive results all hold us back.\n\nNow, for the first time, Morin expands upon the 13 Things from her viral post and shares her tried-and-true practices for increasing mental strength. Increasing your mental strength can change your entire attitude. It takes practice and hard work, but with Morin's specific tips, exercises, and troubleshooting advice, it is possible to not only fortify your mental muscle but also drastically improve the quality of your life.",
