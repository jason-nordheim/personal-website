    title: "Educational Summary",
    summary: "A native to upstate NY; Jason was born and raised in Syracuse, NY. Upon graduating from Jamesville-DeWitt High School in 2012, Jason moved to Rochester, NY to begin his freshman year at Nazareth College in Pittsford, NY, a suburb of Rochester, NY. There he was enrolled in a double major of Business Management and Spanish.\n\nDuring that freshman year, Jason matured greatly and learned a great deal about himself; and in learning more about his goals and values, Jason decided that a larger university, with greater resources and a curriculum that was more focused on technical skills would be a better match for his skills, aptitudes and desired career paths. After a great deal of research and consideration, Jason transferred to Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in 2013 enrolled in the Saunders College of Business and enrolled in the New Media Marketing major offered there.\n\nWith a new school and a new major, Jason excelled, reaching Dean’s list more often than not, and taking on membership and leadership roles in various organizations on campus.\n\nAfter a year in the New Media Marketing program, Jason had the opportunity to take an introductory Web Development introduction class that would help fulfill his minor in Digital Business. Here student’s learned how to create basic web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but what was just a checklist item became Jason’s favorite class. It was then Jason realized his interest and passion for code; he loved the creativity and customization it allowed. He craved more.\n\nPromptly he scheduled a meeting with the his academic advisor to see how best to incorporate more development into his curriculum. It was then that Jason adopted a new major: Management Information Systems or “MIS”, where he would have the opportunity to learn technologies and skills including database management systems, application development, and architectural planning.\n\nAs Jason progressed through the MIS program, he felt himself continually craving more and programming knowledge. He didn’t want to just write the convert business needs to technical requirements, write database schemas, create architectural documentation, user-stories and other technical documentation - Jason wanted to write the application himself. All of it. \n\nWorking with the academic faculty and staff of both the Golisano College of Computer and Information Sciences (GCCIS) and the Saunder’s College of Business, Jason adopted Web Development as a minor - a minor intended only for Computer Science students; it was very uncommon for non-computer science students to elect such a minor primarily due to all the prerequisite course requirements - which in summation totaled 29 college credits, nearly double that of most minors (5 classes). On top of a second minor (Digital Business) and a concentration (3 classes) in Psychology.\n\nJason felt his most employable attribute was that he could speak the lingo of the business, and of the developer. It is all too common in that company’s have a disconnect between the business leaders/decision-maker’s and the software developers; as if the two parties simply didn’t speak the same language. This is where he felt that he could be of greatest utility to company; using his interpersonal skills to convert business requirements to technical requirements and even deliver on the build of the product.\n\nIn 2017, Jason graduated. He’d done well; achieved Dean’s list more often than he did not, he’d had multiple paid co-ops, and taken leadership roles in many on-campus organizations, while working multiple jobs, actively participating in clubs and greek life, and averaging more than a full-course (15 credits) load most semesters. \n\nNo sooner than the Monday following completion of his degree in Management Information Systems, Jason started work at Rochester Precision Optics (RPO) as a “Data Analyst/Programmer” where he helped analyze information in RPO’s ERP system Epicor to provide insight into production efficiencies/deficiencies, supplier pricing, deliver, and a multitude of other KPIs to help RPO use its resources (both human capital, physical capital, and operating time) as effectively as possible, including automating reporting of KPIs for the Director of Supply chain and even validating payroll information using automated pulls from their ERP system passed through an algorithm he spent weeks developing in collaboration with the company’s accounting and payroll departments.\n\nWhile Jason loved working at RPO - especially the 9/80 schedule; Jason missed one thing above all else - a team. A person can grow more, learn more, achieve more - when they work with others on a common goal, so when Jason received a call from Paychex, interested in interviewing him for a position in their IT department, his interest was peaked. \n\nAfter interviewing and screening, Jason got accepted Paychex’s job offer for Desktop Engineer I at Paychex, where he would focus on automating the processes of managing Paychex’s end-user computing environment to ensure a stable, highly-available, and highly performant computing environment, this time as part of a team of engineers from whom he could learn and grow. \n\nJason spent about a year and a half at Paychex, during which time he was promoted to Desktop Engineer II, and was able to make numerous impactful contributions to the organization, and get involved and even lead multiple projects that had visibility to the executive staff at Paychex, but as time progressed, Jason kept feeling a greater and greater itch to for a different kind of challenge; a challenge where he could use and grow his programming knowledge and solve real-world business problems with software - an idea that still incites excitement.\n\nAfter great consideration and consultation with mentors, peers, family and friends - Jason decided to take a risk and quit his job as an engineer to attend a Software Engineering bootcamp. With reluctance, Jason gave his notice and began preparing for a move across the country to Denver, CO where he would re-new his excitement and passion for programming and gain, where he could truly hone his development skills, meet like-minded peers, network with the software development community and get real experience building full-stack applications.\n\nNow closing on graduation from the Flatiron School - completing his bootcamp in Software Engineering, Jason is looking for opportunities to use his creativity and problem-solving skills to contribute to the growth and advancement of software to make meaningful impacts. It is now that the real journey begins. ",
